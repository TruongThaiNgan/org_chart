# Genogram Controller

The `GenogramController` manages data and layout for family trees, handling complex relationships like marriages, parental connections, and gender-based positioning.

## Creating a Controller

```dart
final controller = GenogramController<Person>(
  items: familyMembers,
  idProvider: (person) => person.id.toString(),
  fatherProvider: (person) => person.fatherId?.toString(),
  motherProvider: (person) => person.motherId?.toString(),
  spousesProvider: (person) => person.spouseIds?.map((id) => id.toString()).toList(),
  genderProvider: (person) => person.isMale ? 0 : 1,
  boxSize: const Size(150, 150),
  spacing: 30,
  runSpacing: 60,
);
```

## Constructor Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `items` | `List<E>` | Data items to display in the family tree |
| `idProvider` | `String Function(E)` | Function to extract unique ID from an item |
| `fatherProvider` | `String? Function(E)` | Function to extract father's ID from an item |
| `motherProvider` | `String? Function(E)` | Function to extract mother's ID from an item |
| `spousesProvider` | `List<String>? Function(E)` | Function to extract spouse IDs from an item |
| `genderProvider` | `int Function(E)` | Function to determine gender (0=male, 1=female) |
| `boxSize` | `Size` | Size of each node box (default: `Size(150, 150)`) |
| `spacing` | `double` | Horizontal spacing between nodes (default: `30`) |
| `runSpacing` | `double` | Vertical spacing between rows (default: `60`) |
| `orientation` | `GraphOrientation` | Layout direction (default: `topToBottom`) |

## Key Methods

### Family Relationship Methods

```dart
// Get root nodes (individuals with no parents)
List<Node<Person>> roots = controller.roots;

// Get children of specific individuals
List<Node<Person>> children = controller.getChildren([fatherNode, motherNode]);

// Get parents of an individual
List<Node<Person>> parents = controller.getParents(childNode);

// Get spouses of an individual
List<Node<Person>> spouses = controller.getSpouseList(personData);

// Gender helper methods
bool isMale = controller.isMale(personData);
bool isFemale = controller.isFemale(personData);
```

## Layout Algorithm

The genogram controller implements a sophisticated layout algorithm that:

1. Places couples (spouses) next to each other:
   - Husbands and wives are positioned side-by-side
   - Multiple spouses are arranged in sequence
   
2. Groups children together:
   - Children of the same parents are positioned together
   - Half-siblings are ordered by their mother's position

3. Positions generations hierarchically:
   - Oldest generation at the top/left (based on orientation)
   - Each subsequent generation below/right of their parents
   
4. Centers parents above their children:
   - The algorithm balances the parent group to be centered above the child group

The positioning supports both orientations:
- `GraphOrientation.topToBottom`: Parents above children
- `GraphOrientation.leftToRight`: Parents to the left of children

## Sibling Ordering

The controller has special logic to keep siblings visually grouped:

```dart
// The controller automatically sorts siblings by:
// 1. Children of the same father and mother stay together
// 2. Children with the same father are grouped by mother
// 3. Siblings are ordered based on their mother's position
```

## Cache Optimization

For performance with large family trees, an internal cache is maintained:

```dart
// Access methods use caching for better performance
List<Node<Person>> spouses = controller.getSpouseList(person); // Uses cache

// Clear caches when data changes significantly
controller.items = updatedFamilyMembers; // Automatically clears caches
```
